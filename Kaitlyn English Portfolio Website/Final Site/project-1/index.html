            <p>A cove is a peaceful nook of a body of water where the waves meet the land. They are secluded little spaces that are quiet and serene. Throughout the design, the curved shape of a cove will influence many aspects of the project. The floor plan will follow along the curved edge of the river on the site and use the landscape to bring the design into nature. The interior of the building will be highlighted with arched doorways and hallways. There will also be coved ceiling details and lighting throughout the spaces. Like the rugged cliffs around a cove, different stones will be the feature of walls and furniture. The water in a cove will be represented with fountains and water features that create ambient sounds for relaxation. With the use of color, harmony will be brought into the space. Blues and greens will resemble water, and whites, creams and tans will resemble stone and sand. The use of linens will bring soft and comforting textures to the design. A calm environment will be achieved by balancing between all of the materials and details throughout the project.</p>
