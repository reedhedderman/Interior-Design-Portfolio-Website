            <p>The purpose of this design was to create a co-working space in downtown Chicago. The inspiration was Chicago's famous Cloud Gate, often referred to as "the bean." A bean represents growth and success, which is what every working person needs reminder of in their life. The "bean" is Chicago's most popular sculpture that is in the heart of Millennium Park. Its reflective liquid mercury exterior captures the beautiful colors of its surroundings. Like the bean, we wanted the people in our space to absorb the environment we designed to encourage creativity and productivity. In this colorful workspace, there are rich colors of blues and oranges to reflect both the sky as well as the light from the sun and buildings nearby. To capture the shape of the sculpture, the space has curved elements of furniture and patterns. Each of these elements work seamlessly together to create a smooth, but fun and colorful work environment.</p>
