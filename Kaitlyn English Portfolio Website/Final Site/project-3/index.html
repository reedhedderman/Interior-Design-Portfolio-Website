            <p>The Amalfi Coast is well known for its colorful villages, narrow streets, beaches, cuisine and local wine. The concept for this boutique hotel will embody each of these aspects that the Amalfi Coast represents. Beautiful colors of blues, yellows, oranges, greens, reds and pinks will be represented throughout the entirety of the resort. The bright colors will work in harmony with the style and placement of the buildings to create a feeling of comfort and charm that the towns of the coast possesses. With this coziness, the resort will have a sense of relaxation and calmness, the same way that one feels at the beach. While the hotel will promote relaxation, it will also have many opportunities for guests to try something new and have a fun, exciting time. The main attraction for visitors to participate in will be wine tasting events from local vineyards, which is a popular thing to do in Italy as well. All of these features will come together to create a beautiful environment for friends and family to make new memories.</p>
